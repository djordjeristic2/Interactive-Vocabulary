# Interactive-Vocabulary
I created a simple script using some data.json file, which can be replaced with any other data found on the internet. 
The script asks User to enter some Input, matches a word with .keys() in json data, and outputs the deffinition of that word.
Also, the word which user enter's is checked for some missclicking or misspelling, and the scripts offers you the correct word. 

Feel free to try it yourself, and to replace the data stored inside.
